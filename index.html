                        Máirtín Ó Cadhain was a teacher, socialist, Irish republican, and perhaps the most acclaimed Irish-language writer of the
                        twentieth-century.
                        <em>Cré na Cille</em>, his most famous novel, has been called “savage, uproarious, scabrous, obnoxious
                        and hilarious” and “The greatest novel to be written in the Irish language, and among the best books
                        to come out of Ireland in the twentieth century.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He was born in 1906, the second of thirteen children, into a completely Irish-speaking area in West Galway and would claim
                        he never heard English spoken until he was six. Thanks to a scholarship he was able to attend St
                        Patrick’s College, Drumcondra and became a primary school teacher in Camas, Co. Galway in 1927. During
                        the late 1920s he joined both the IRA and the INTO (Irish National Teacher’s Organization), reflecting
                        his nationalism and trade-unionism.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He became active in Irish language rights campaigning, being one of the founders of
                        <em>Muintir na Gaeltachta</em> [People of the Gaeltacht] in 1934 and founding a branch of the Gaelic
                        League in An Carn Mór. He was instrumental in the campaign to have land in Meath redistributed from
                        wealthy cattle farmers to families from poor Irish-speaking districts, which lead to the founding
                        of the Ráth Cairn Gaeltacht in 1935.

                        <p>An uirnis liteartha is fearr a fuair mé ó mo mhuintir an chaint, caint thíriúil, caint chréúil, caint

                            The best literary device I got from my people was their talk; rough, earthy, salty speech that starts dancing on me sometimes,
                            crying on me other times, whether I like it or not.</p>

                        His republican activities caused him trouble, however, and he was dismissed from his teaching post in 1936, imprisoned in
                        Arbour Hill in 1939, and interned in the Curragh camp, which he called
                        <em>Sibéir na hÉireann</em> [Ireland’s Siberia], from 1940 to 1944. He launched educational projects
                        to help his fellow internees, teaching Irish and history and starting a journal. During his internment,
                        he taught himself Russian, read widely in Irish, French and English, and wrote furiously. After his
                        release, however, he could only find menial work, stockpiling turf during a fuel shortage and working
                        on building sites in Dublin and England. He married Máirín Ní Rodaigh, an Irish-language teacher,
                        in 1945.

                    <p>
                        Before his imprisonment, he had published collections of folklore in the Irish journal
                        <em>Béaloideas</em>, (loosely) translated Charles Kickham’s novel
                        <em>Sally Kavanagh</em> into Irish, and published his first collection of short stories
                        <em>Idir Shúgradh agus Dáiríre</em> [Half in Jest, Half in Earnestness] (1939). In 1947 he became a translator
                        in
                        <em>Rannóg an Aistriúcháin</em> [the Translation Office], which gave him the time and money to edit and
                        publish the works that would make his reputation.

                    <p>
                        He remains best known for his novel
                        <em>Cré na Cille</em> (serialized in 1949 and published in 1950). This work, which is bitingly satirical
                        of both canonical Irish-language literature and modern Irish society, takes place entirely in a Conamara
                        village graveyard. All the characters are dead, fight constantly, and are desperate to know how their
                        local rivals are getting on back above ground. Ó Cadhain claimed he got the idea from attending a
                        funeral where the gravediggers accidentally opened the wrong grave but since the weather was so bad
                        they buried two enemies together anyway. The gravedigger said “Ó bhó go deo nach ann a bheas an ‘grammar’!”
                        [What an argument there will be there!].
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ó Cadhain’s style drew from dialectical material, classical Irish literature, and Irish’s sister language Scots Gaelic. He
                        had exceptional knowledge of the Conamara dialect of Irish, having collected over 800,000 examples
                        for a proposed Irish dictionary. His novel was both praised for its linguistic experimentation and
                        criticized for its vulgarity. Ó Cadhain recalled with pride the time he overheard two passengers
                        on a bus talk about his work and call him “A right galoot if ever there was one. A Joycean smutmonger.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He went on to publish several short story collections, repeatedly won the Oireachtas prize for Irish-language writing, and
                        in 1956 was made a lecturer in Irish at Trinity College Dublin (Ireland’s oldest and most prestigious
                        university). From 1953-56 he used his column in the Irish Times to attack the government for failing
                        to support Irish-language speakers. In the 1960s he was significantly involved in the organization
                        <em>Misneach</em> [Courage], which agitated for language rights, and
                        <em>Gluaiseacht Chearta Sibhialta na Gaeltachta</em> [the Gaeltacht Civil Rights Movement]. In 1969 he
                        was appointed Professor of Irish in Trinity College Dublin but his health was failing and he died
                        in Dublin in 1970.

                        For years much of Ó Cadhain’s work was available only in Irish and was often out of print. Although he gained a reputation
                        as the Irish language equivalent of James Joyce or W.B. Yeats, he was more praised than read. In
                        recent years he has finally managed to receive greater attention both inside and outside Ireland
                        with the translation of his works into English, especially Alan Titley’s translation of
                        <em>Cré na Cille</em>,
                        <em>The Dirty Dust</em>, in 2015. His work has so far been translated into Danish, Norwegian, German,
                        Dutch, and Czech, with translations into French and Russian forthcoming

                            Is deacair do dhuine a dhícheall a dhéanamh i dteanga arb é a cosúlacht go mbeidh sí básaithe roimhe féin, má fhaigheann
                            sé cupla bliain eile saoil. Fonn troda go fíochmhar ar a son a ghineas an t-éadóchas sin ann.

                            It is hard for a writer to do his best in a language which seems set to die before he does, if he lives a few years longer.
                            This despair ignites a fierce desire to fight for its survival; but neither despair nor fighting
                            are to his advantage as a writer.
